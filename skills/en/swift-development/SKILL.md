# Swift 6 Development Skill

## Instructions

Follow this guide when working on non-UI Swift code, business logic, algorithms, or the data layer. Your goal is to write high-performance, thread-safe, and expressive Swift code.

## What This Skill Does

- **Concurrent Programming**: Write safe concurrent code using Actors, async/await, Task, and TaskGroup.
- **Type Safety**: Define Sendable types and use Typed Throws for precise error handling.
- **Testing**: Write modern unit tests using the Swift Testing framework.
- **Data Processing**: Write Codable models and encapsulate JSON parsing and network requests.
- **Macros**: Use or create macros to reduce boilerplate.

## When to Use This Skill

- When writing ViewModel, Service, or Repository layer code.
- When defining data models (structs, enums).
- When implementing algorithms or utility functions.
- When writing unit tests.
- When fixing concurrency warnings or data races.

## Examples

### Example 1: Defining a Safe Actor Service

```swift
/// A thread-safe user data service
actor UserService {
    private var cache: [String: User] = [:]
    
    // Use typed throws to specify the error type explicitly
    func fetchUser(id: String) async throws(NetworkError) -> User {
        if let cached = cache[id] {
            return cached
        }
        
        // Simulate network request
        let user = try await NetworkClient.shared.get("/users/\(id)", as: User.self)
        cache[id] = user
        return user
    }
}
```

### Example 2: Testing with Swift Testing

```swift
import Testing
@testable import MyApp

@Test("User parsing should succeed")
func userParsing() async throws {
    let json = """
    { "id": "1", "name": "Alice" }
    """.data(using: .utf8)!
    
    let user = try JSONDecoder().decode(User.self, from: json)
    
    #expect(user.name == "Alice")
    #expect(user.id == "1")
}
```

## Best Practices

- **Conform to Sendable**: Any type passed between concurrency domains must conform to the `Sendable` protocol.
- **Avoid Global Mutable State**: Avoid global variables unless protected by an Actor.
- **Implicitly Unwrapped Optionals**: Strictly forbidden (`!`), except where unavoidable in initializers (very rare).
- **Use `let` over `var`**: Default to constants; use variables only when necessary.
- **Error Handling**: Prefer `throws` and `do-catch` over returning `Optional` or `Result` types (throws is more natural in async contexts).

## Notes

- Always pay attention to "Strict Concurrency Checking" compiler warnings.
- When handling closures across Actor boundaries, be mindful of `[weak self]` or `[unowned self]` (though usually not needed in `Task` unless breaking a reference cycle).
